Latest Updates on QA Space
Hello Friends!

Happy Holidays and a warm welcome to all the New Students who Joined my tutorials in this Black Friday sale. I assure you a top-class learning experience in all my QA Automation Courses with detailed explanations.

On side note, here are quick updates I want to share about new innovations which are trending in QA Space related to the courses you enrolled.

1. There is latest IDE editor in the market called “AQUA” which is exclusively developed for Automation testers especially for Selenium testers. This tool have many features which makes our lives easy such as Inspecting WebElements of Web Pages with in IDE, Validating CSS,Xpath inside IDE with out even switching to browser to grab elements. Please check out below 15min video about full details about this IDE and its features

https://youtu.be/OdVO-jqUH0M

2. From Selenium V 4.6.0 , There is no need to set below step to invoke browsers.

System.setProperty(“webdriver.chrome.driver”, “/path/to/chromedriver”)

Selenium team pushed new inbuilt package called Selenium Manager which automatically detects your browser version and download respective driver.exe and set it in system path. Please see below video for complete info on this

https://youtu.be/KIn6we9rNh0

That’s it for now. See you again in January with more updates on new lectures/topics which are being added in the courses.



Hope you guys will have a wonderful rest of the Year.
