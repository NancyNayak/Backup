Cypress still has lot to do in automation world, but once it fully fledged enters the market, then there is no going back. Thus would be the power of cypress. About this course, as usual, Rahul never disappoints. This course was at par with the teaching levels and simply I learned one more technology with the help of Rahul. Few more framework creation examples would have made it more robust. Thanks Rahul for this well defined course.
