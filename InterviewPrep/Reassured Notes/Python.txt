Environment variable- we have to set two environment variable-
-Python path
-Python script path

PIP- standard package manager for python. It allows to install and manage additional packages that are not part of Python library.
In python- package is there just like jars in java

Seleium install-

Python, Selenium Installation Guide Download
Installing Python and Selenium

Installing Python:

Windows : http://python.org/download/.

Note : IF you are using Linux, MacOS X, Unix operating Systems then python will be installed by default with OS

1.What is PIP installer Tool?
pip is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python
pip is a recursive acronym that can stand for either "Pip Installs Packages" or "Pip Installs Python

2.Where do we get this PIP Tool? And how to configure it in our Local Machines

3.Installing Selenium
Use Below command on PIP to install Selenium Package
pip install selenium

This command will set up the Selenium WebDriver client library on your machine with all modules and classes that we will need to create automated scripts using Python

4.pip install -U selenium
The optional â€“U flag will upgrade the existing version of the installed package

Python basics:
we can declare multiple variable in one line:
b,c,d=5,6.4,"Great"

Data types in python
Numeric-Int,float,long,double
String
List- 
a=[1,3,"n"]
Tuple
b=(1,2,4)
Truple is same like list but its immutable
Dictionary
c={1:2,4:5,"n":4}
dictionary- key value pair just like hashmap


if we haveto add elements in dictionary, we can add using below code:
dic= {}
dic[1]=4
dic[4]=5

if we have to concat two datatypes , we can do in below format:
print("{} {}".format("value is",b))

for loop-
a=[1,2,3,4,6]
for in range(1,3):
   print(a)
   
while loop
i=10
while i>10
  print(i)
  i=i-1
  
  Functions in python
def add(a,b):
  print(a+b)
  
  
Oops concepts in python
classes- userdefined blueprint and protype
Classes will have variabes, method, instance variable, Constructor in python
We will create object without using new operator in python
 for eg-
 class Calculater:
 
 obj= Calculater() - syntax to create the object in python
 obj.method
 obj.variable
 
Constructor in python
def _init_(sef)--------init method is used to declare constructor in python
