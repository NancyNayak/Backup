Depencies that need to be imported fOR restassured:
 Restassured
 json
 Gson
 scema validator
 Jackson
 jsonPath
 
Restassured sopport BDD style.
given()- cintent-type, set cookies, add auth, add param, set headers info
when()- put, post, delete, get
then()- validate status code, extract response, rxtract headers cookies, response body.

given method includes when and then

 structure is
 given()
 .when()
 .then()
 we can also write like
  when()
 .then()
 
 Whatever first method we wil use we will not put . in first method


For Restassured to identifu BDD keywords, static packages need to be imported.

1. 3 static pcakages:

import static io.restassured.RestAssured.*;
import static io.restassured.matcher.RestAssuredMatchers.*;
 import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.*;
 
 

2. Query and pathparameter

3. How to check cookies and headers from response- get cookies and getgeaders methods ae there.

4 ways to pass pay load in req:
1. usimg hashMap
2. using  org.json library- by JSONObject
3. POJO CLASS 
4. using json file -


5.Response have- Body, Headers, Cookies

6. log().all() 	- for log all response
    log(). cookies- for log cookies
	log(). header- for log headers
	
	
	
7 Valitade response body: xml and json
we need dependency  jsonPath for validating json response.
 We have different approch to validate json response:
 -using json path eg- Book[3].Titte
 -using testng Assert
 
 8-Parsing data into json - we can pasrse data using JSON oBject class
  JSONObject JO =new JSONObject(rs.asString());
  JO.getJSONArray.getJSON OBject 
 9 For XML parsing we use XmlPATH class
  XmlPATH XmlObj= new XmlATH(rs.asString());
  XmLObj.getList() 
 
 
asString- To convert entire response into string
toString()- To convert the data of xml

getList method is used for XmlPATH
 	


-If we return the response in any variable then we can we can verify the response in when() section only with JSONObject class for JSON and XMLPath class for xml
if we have to verify the resppnse without storing variable then we can very in then() section using Body( jspnpath/xmlpath,"expected value") method

-------------------------------------------------------------
File upload and download 

Upload:
In postman we send file in body- Form-data. In key we can choose file and in value we can chhose test1

In Restassured:
we use 
// single file
 File myfile= new File();
  given().
  multipart("file","myFile"); // multipart is used for form-data type.
  .contentType("multipart/formdata")
  
  
  // multiple file
 File myfile1= new File
  File myfile2= new File();

  given().
  multipart("files","myFile1"); // We have to write multipart multiple times in case of multiple file.
    multipart("files","myFile2"); //  
  .contentType("multipart/formdata")
  
  
  Dowload:
	using get method  where we provide filename in URL of get method (here content of file will the be the response)and  verify status code as 200 and body
--------------------------------------------------------------------
	 json/XML SCHEMA validation
	 
	 Response Validation- data validattion
	 Schema Validation- Type of data validation
	 
	 We can create one file json scheme under resorces folder 
	 JSON Schema Validation Can be done by using JsonSchemaValidator.matchesJsonSchemaInClasspath("filename.json")
	 JsonSchemaValidator is class 
	 
	 Soap api gives xml response
	 Postman does not support xml schema validation
	 using java scriptwe  can validate xml schema validation
	 
	 Using Restassured we can validate xml schema validation
	 
	 From JSON Response we can create JSONschema which is in json format
	 	 From XML Response we can create XMLschema which is in (.xsd) format-
		 xsd is XML schema format
		 
		 Now a days nobody use xml
		 
		 XML schema can be verified by using Restassuredmatcher.matchesXSDinclasspath("filename.xsd"  )
		 
		 
		 JSon schema coverter we used to convert json response to scheme
		 		 XML to xsd  coverter we used to convert xml response to xmlschema
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Serilaization and Deserilaization- Its internal process in RestAssured

Seriallization- POJO to JSON (Java object is haveay and non secure that why we convert java object to json)
This is internal programing conept, Restssured automatically take cares.
In the network data navigates in th e form of json

Deserialization- JSON to POJO


jackson databind library is used for serialization and deserilaization- its programming concept
ObjectMapper class is used for this which is under jacson databind library


POJO---->JSON Serialization:
ObjectMapper objMapper =new ObjectMapper();
String jsonData=objMapper.writerWithDaefaultPrettyPrinter().writeValueAsString(Pojo object);(This will convert into string as json format)


Why we convert  javaobject into json--> because json is light object

JSON--------->POJO Deserialization:-

ObjectMapper objMapper =new ObjectMapper();
Student stupojo=ObjectMapper.readvalue("JSONDATA",Student.class);-readvalued will convert jason into student class object
stupojo.getName()----using getter we can have get details



--------------Authentication/aUTHORIZATION
Authentication- user is valid or not
Authorization- permission
